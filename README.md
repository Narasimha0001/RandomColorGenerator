# 🎨 Color Box Generator

This project is a simple, responsive web app that generates and displays a random HEX color. When the user clicks the **"Change"** button, the color of the box updates, and the HEX code is shown and applied to other elements for visual effect.

## 🖼️ UI Overview

* The interface includes a white card (`#bg`) centered on a light grey background.
* Inside the card:

  * A black box (`#box`) takes up 80% of the container and changes color dynamically.
  * A button labeled **"Change"** triggers the color update.
  * A text field below displays the current HEX code and adopts the same color.

---

## 🔧 How It Works

* On page load or when the **Change** button is clicked:

  * A random 6-digit HEX color is generated.
  * The color is applied to:

    * The `#box` background
    * The button background (`#bt`)
    * The text color (`#text`)
  * The HEX value is shown in `#text`.
